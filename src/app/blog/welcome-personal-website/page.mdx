I am happy to welcome you on my first personal website! I had planned to make a personal website 
for myself for years now but I never took the time.

<Image src={website} alt="screenshot of my website" />

This website is built with Typescript 5, React 18, TailwindCSS 3 and NextJS 13. 
Each blog post is writter in <TextLink href="https://mdxjs.com/">MDX</TextLink> which is basically Markdown for javascript and typescript.


It is hosted on <TextLink href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</TextLink> on my domain celine.im
Vercel is free or hobbist and very convenient!
It builds automatically from my github repository after every commit!

This is exactly the tech stack I needed for my personal website. Fast and Easy! 
I highly recommend it if you are looking to build your small website.


<ThankYouLink/>
