# Celine Bursztein personal website 

I am using a customized version of Spotlight. A site template based on Tailwind UI.
Spotlight is a [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com) site template built using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website.

## Production
The site is deployed on Vercel.
